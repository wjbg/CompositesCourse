A set of Matlab functions for the Classical Lamination Theory as used
in the Master course on Composites at the University of Twente. This
version does not work out-of-the-box as a number of functions are
incomplete. Completion of these functions is left as an exercise to
the students.

For a working version of the Classical Lamination Theory, you can
visit the [m.CLT](https://github.com/wjbg/m.CLT) repository.
